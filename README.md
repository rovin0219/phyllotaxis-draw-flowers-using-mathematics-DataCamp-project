# phyllotaxis-draw-flowers-using-mathematics-DataCamp-project

## Project Description

#### R is a tool for doing serious statistics and data analysis. But not everything in life can be serious, life is also beautiful, and R can make beautiful things too. R can make art.

The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called phyllotaxis and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.

This R project assumes you have familiarity with the ggplot2 package. If you want to see more examples of how you can use R to make art, you should check out the Fronkonstin blog created by Antonio Sánchez Chinchón.
